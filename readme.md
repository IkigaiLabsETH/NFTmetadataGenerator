This is a repo for generating metadata dynamically based on rarity.
It is setup for the Solana blockchain.

Simply Fill the directory with the pngs you want to sample from,
And then edit script.py with your own .png files and desired rarities.

The script will generate the JSON, png, and log the results for you to verify.
