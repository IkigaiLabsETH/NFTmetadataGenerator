Simply Fill the directory with the pngs you want to sample from,
And then edit script.py with your own .png files and desired rarities.

The script will generate the JSON, png, and log the results for you to verify.  

Ex.
> python script.py <br>
sonic.png: 100 NFTs created <br>
tails.png: 100 NFTs created <br>
knuckles.png: 100 NFTs created <br>
amy.png: 75 NFTs created <br>
big.png: 50 NFTs created <br>
shadow.png: 50 NFTs created <br>
eggman.png: 20 NFTs created <br>
